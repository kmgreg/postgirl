A lightweight Qt alternative to Postman

## What?
A tool to send HTTP requests and see what happens.

## Why?
Most of my coding is done in VMs, and as such RAM comes at a premium. Consider this my protest against the growing ubiquity of Electron.

## What's with the Name?
Somewhat inspired by Postwoman (now Hoppscotch) and the fact Qt projects tends to have "cutesy" theming (e.g. KDE).
